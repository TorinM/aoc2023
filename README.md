# Advent of Code 2023

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) puzzles.

All solutions are written in Rust.

## How To Run

Each contain their own binary. Each read a file called `input.txt` in the same directory as the binary.

To run a solution, navigate to the directory of the day and run the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
./target/release/dayXX
```

## Solutions

Each solution is in a directory named `dayXX` where `XX` is the day of the puzzle.
